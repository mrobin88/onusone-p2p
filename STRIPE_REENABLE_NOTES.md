# ðŸš§ Stripe Integration - Re-enable for Production

## Current Status
- **Stripe integration is temporarily disabled** for local development
- **Reason**: Stripe was causing runtime errors that interfered with posting functionality
- **Error**: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'match')`

## What Was Disabled
- `frontend/pages/buy-onu.tsx` - Stripe Elements wrapper
- `loadStripe()` initialization
- Credit card payment forms

## How to Re-enable for Production

### 1. Restore Stripe Promise
```typescript
// In frontend/pages/buy-onu.tsx
const stripePromise = loadStripe(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY!);
```

### 2. Restore Elements Wrapper
```typescript
export default function BuyONU() {
  return (
    <Elements stripe={stripePromise}>
      <BuyONUForm />
    </Elements>
  );
}
```

### 3. Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Add to Vercel dashboard or .env.production
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
```

### 4. Test Stripe Integration
- Verify Stripe keys are valid
- Test credit card payment flow
- Ensure ONU token delivery works
- Check webhook handling

## Why This Was Done
- **Local Development**: Stripe errors were blocking basic app functionality
- **User Experience**: Users couldn't post messages due to Stripe initialization errors
- **Development Speed**: Removed blocker for testing core features

## Production Checklist
- [ ] Stripe keys configured in production environment
- [ ] Stripe webhook endpoints configured
- [ ] Payment flow tested end-to-end
- [ ] ONU token delivery verified
- [ ] Error handling for failed payments
- [ ] Refund process documented

## Alternative Solutions Considered
1. **Conditional Stripe loading** - Only load in production
2. **Error boundary** - Catch Stripe errors gracefully
3. **Lazy loading** - Load Stripe only when needed

## Current Workaround
- Buy ONU page shows "Temporarily Disabled" message
- Users can still post messages and use core features
- Stripe integration will be restored for production launch

*This note should be reviewed before production deployment to ensure Stripe integration is properly restored.*
