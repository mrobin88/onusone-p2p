# 👑 Reputation System Implementation - REAL USER TRACKING

## ✅ **FIXED: Reputation System Stub → Complete User Reputation Tracking**

The reputation system has been **completely transformed** from hardcoded placeholder values to a comprehensive, real-time user behavior tracking system with sophisticated scoring, badges, and leaderboards.

### 🚨 **What Was Broken**
- ❌ **Hardcoded reputation values**: Random numbers generated for display
- ❌ **No reputation storage**: No persistent tracking of user behavior  
- ❌ **No reputation actions**: No system to record and score user contributions
- ❌ **Placeholder leaderboards**: Mock data with fake users and scores

### ✅ **What's Now Working**

#### **1. Complete Reputation Manager** (`lib/reputation-manager.ts`)
```typescript
// Sophisticated reputation calculation and management
export class ReputationManager {
  calculateReputationScore(actions: ReputationAction[]): number {
    // Real scoring based on user actions
  }
  
  calculateRank(score: number): { rank: string; color: string; progress: number } {
    // 7-tier rank system: Newcomer → Pioneer
  }
  
  calculateBadges(reputation: UserReputation): string[] {
    // Dynamic badge assignment based on achievements
  }
}

// 26 different action types tracked
enum ReputationActionType {
  POST_CREATE, POST_LIKED, STAKE_TOKENS, HELPFUL_REPLY, 
  CONTENT_FEATURED, SPAM_DETECTED, // ... and 20 more
}
```

#### **2. Real-Time Reputation APIs** (`api/reputation/`)
```typescript
// Track user actions with automatic scoring
POST /api/reputation/track
{
  "userId": "user123",
  "action": "post_create", 
  "reason": "Created a new post",
  "relatedContent": "post_456"
}

// Get complete user reputation profile
GET /api/reputation/user/[userId]
{
  "reputation": { currentScore, rank, badges, stats },
  "summary": { strengths, suggestions, nextRankPoints },
  "recentActions": [...],
  "leaderboard": { position, percentile }
}

// Global leaderboard with trending users
GET /api/reputation/leaderboard
{
  "leaderboard": [...], // Top users with full profiles
  "trending": [...],    // Most active in last 24h
  "globalStats": {...}  // Network-wide statistics
}
```

#### **3. Comprehensive Reputation Display** (`components/ReputationDisplay.tsx`)
```typescript
// Rich reputation component with multiple views
<ReputationDisplay 
  userId={user.id}
  showActions={true}    // Show recent activity
  compact={false}       // Full profile vs inline display
/>

// Features:
// ✅ Live reputation score and rank
// ✅ Progress bar to next rank
// ✅ Badge collection display
// ✅ Activity statistics grid
// ✅ Strengths and improvement suggestions
// ✅ Recent action history with icons
// ✅ Debug tools for development
```

#### **4. Global Reputation Leaderboard** (`pages/leaderboard.tsx`)
```typescript
// Complete leaderboard experience
// ✅ Top contributors with full profiles
// ✅ Global network statistics
// ✅ Trending users (24h activity) 
// ✅ User's personal ranking
// ✅ Reputation earning guide
// ✅ Pagination for large user bases
// ✅ Real-time badge and rank display
```

#### **5. Integrated Reputation Tracking** (Throughout the app)
- ✅ **Post creation**: +5 reputation points automatically
- ✅ **Post engagement**: +2 for likes, +2 for comments, +3 for shares
- ✅ **Token staking**: +10 reputation points per stake
- ✅ **Daily login**: +1 reputation point (ready for implementation)
- ✅ **Content featured**: +50 reputation points (admin triggered)
- ✅ **Spam detection**: -25 reputation points (automatic penalties)
